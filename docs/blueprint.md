- Sentiment Display: Present the lexical tokens, syntax validity, sentiment analysis result (Positive, Negative, or Neutral), and overall sentiment score.
- Syntax Check (Optional): Validate sentence structure using grammar rules or NLP libraries, confirming formats like subject-verb-object.
- Sentiment Lexicon Update Tool: Allow users to add or modify words and their sentiment scores, enabling a personalized or domain-specific tool.
